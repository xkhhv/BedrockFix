# BedrockFix
A PocketMine-MP plugin that either fixes or breaks the game more.
Our lovely mojang devs ship MCBE with new monthly features, some of us may mistake it for bugs. This plugin will teach you that those are in fact features that you mistook for bugs.

### WARNING!
This plugin uses various hacky methods to combat bugs. Also this plugin doesn't really combat bugs, it only exchanges the bugs with less annoying or less frequent bugs. So, expect bugs!

## What is fixed?
- **Entity metadata: **This does come at the cost of respawning an entity, but consider nametags updating as they should have and entities going invisible when they should, etc...
